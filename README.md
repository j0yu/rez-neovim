[rez] package to install [Neovim].

Here are some beginners instructions on how to use this repository.

## Installation

1. Install [rez] via `python install.py` method
1. Clone/download this repository
1. Ensure at least the folder printed by
   this command `rez config local_packages_path`
1. Open terminal in (extracted) repository folder,
   run `rez build --install`

Neovim should now be installed as a [rez] package named `neovim`.

## Usage

To run [Neovim]: `rez env neovim -- neovim`


## Extra Topics

### Skip downloading installer

If you already have the **raw** Neovim tar/zip downloaded from the Foundry's
website, place it inside the (extracted) repository folder without renaming it.

Then `rez build --install` should skip re-downloading the Neovim tar/zip.

### Licensing

If you already have a license server setup, e.g. at the port and address 
`1234@licenseserver`, you can run Neovim like:

```bash
rez env neovim -- foundry_LICENSE=1234@licenseserver neovim
```

There are many ways to go about setting up licenses for rez packages e.g.

1. Modify this rez package build to include your own custom `neovim`
   launcher script which sets up your licenses
1. Have a separate `licenses` rez package to handle licenses used by your 
   studio. 
   
   This can then be added as a [requirement] e.g. `requires = ["licenses"]`

Which method you go by will depend on your current situation.


## Maintenance

Whenever new official release come out, update the `__version__`
in `package.py` then re-run `rez build --install`.

If you decide to make another install, e.g. new `commands()` environment
setup, you can instead just update the `+local.` version number to indicate
new releases/versions of your own. See [PEP 540 local version segments].

Also, you can rename `+local.` to something more relevant to you 
e.g. `+mystudio.` or  `+mygithubname.`
